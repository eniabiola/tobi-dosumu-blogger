# Assignment: Develop a Blog Web App (blogger)

### This is part of a series of PHP assignments at Upperlink (where I intern). 
### The objective of this assignment is to develop a blog whereby a user is 
### required to signup and login before she/he is able to create blog posts.
## I call mine blogger (even though I know that name already exists. ðŸ˜Š)
