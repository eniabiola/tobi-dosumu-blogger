# Assignment: Develop a Blog Web App (blogger)

### This is part of a series of PHP assignments at Upperlink (where I intern). 
### The objective of this assignment is to develop a blog wherein a user will be 
### required to signup and login before she/he will be able to create blog posts.
## I decided to call mine blogger (even though I know that name already exists. ðŸ˜Š)
